# Munder Difflin Multi-Agent System Project

Welcome to the starter code repository for the **Munder Difflin Paper Company Multi-Agent System Project**! This repository contains the starter code and tools you will need to design, build, and test a multi-agent system that supports core business operations at a fictional paper manufacturing company.

## Project Context

You’ve been hired as an AI consultant by Munder Difflin Paper Company, a fictional enterprise looking to modernize their workflows. They need a smart, modular **multi-agent system** to automate:

- **Inventory checks** and restocking decisions
- **Quote generation** for incoming sales inquiries
- **Order fulfillment** including supplier logistics and transactions

Your solution must use a maximum of **5 agents** and process inputs and outputs entirely via **text-based communication**.

This project challenges your ability to orchestrate agents using modern Python frameworks like `smolagents`, `pydantic-ai`, or `npcsh`, and combine that with real data tools like `sqlite3` and `pandas`.

---

## What’s Included

From the `project.zip` starter archive, you will find:

- `project_starter.py`: The main Python script you will modify to implement your agent system
- `quotes.csv`: Historical quote data used for reference by quoting agents
- `quote_requests.csv`: Incoming customer requests used to build quoting logic
- `quote_requests_sample.csv`: A set of simulated test cases to evaluate your system
- `Agent_workflow.png` and `Agent_workflow.mmd`: Rendered workflow and its editable Mermaid source
- `design_notes.txt`: Architecture, design reflection, and full-sample evaluation

---

## Workspace Instructions

The completed implementation selects `smolagents` and uses framework `ToolCallingAgent` instances with managed-agent delegation. Install dependencies from the project requirements file.

## Local setup instructions

1. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

You can install all required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How to Run the Project

Run `python project_starter.py` from the project directory. The full sample
evaluation runs through the smolagents manager and specialist agents. The
local deterministic model adapter does not require an API key or external
model service.

Output will include:

- Agent responses
- Cash and inventory updates
- Final financial report
- A `test_results.csv` file with all interaction logs
- An internal-only `business_advisor_report.txt`

Run the focused framework delegation test with
`python -m unittest test_framework_workflow -v` from this directory.

---

## Tips for Success

- Start by sketching a **flow diagram** to visualize agent responsibilities and interactions.
- Test individual agent tools before full orchestration.
- Always include **dates** in customer requests when passing data between agents.
- Ensure every quote includes **bulk discounts** and uses past data when available.
- Use the **exact item names** from the database to avoid transaction failures.

## Submission Checklist

Make sure to submit the following files:

1. Your completed `template.py` or `project_starter.py` with all agent logic
2. A **workflow diagram** describing your agent architecture and data flow
3. A `README.txt` or `design_notes.txt` explaining how your system works
4. Outputs from your test run (like `test_results.csv`)
